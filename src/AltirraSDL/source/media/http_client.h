//	AltirraSDL - HTTPS client for online metadata providers
//
//	Scope: one blocking HTTPS GET, redirects followed, cancellable.
//	Used by the Game Library metadata scraper (see metadata_scraper.h).
//
//	This is deliberately NOT the netplay client.  netplay/http_minimal.*
//	is a plain-HTTP, no-TLS, 5-second-bounded client for the lobby
//	directory, and its header explicitly says that anything needing TLS,
//	redirects or compression should use a real library rather than extend
//	it.  This module is that "real library" path: it wraps whatever HTTPS
//	facility the platform already provides, so no new bundled dependency
//	enters the tree.
//
//	  Linux / macOS   libcurl, dlopen()ed at runtime (never link-time, so
//	                  the AppImage uses the host's libcurl and therefore
//	                  the host's CA store)
//	  Windows         WinHTTP (Windows SDK, always present)
//	  Android         java.net.HttpsURLConnection via JNI
//	  WASM            unsupported — Emscripten only offers async fetch,
//	                  and Available() reports false so callers degrade
//
//	Availability is a first-class state, not an error: when Available()
//	is false the metadata feature disables itself with an explanation
//	rather than failing at every call site.
//
//	Threading: Get() is blocking and reentrant.  Several worker threads
//	may call it concurrently; each call owns its own connection.  The
//	one-time backend initialisation is serialised internally.
